## Description and elevator pitch
This is an GAME API, where a USER can signup, name a character, and select a class and preserve user info in a database. USER either creates or selects a character then chooses an action. USER will continue selecting action until opponent is defeated or USER loses. Current API has three classes: hero, warrior, archer. There are three floors for the USER to explore at this time.
